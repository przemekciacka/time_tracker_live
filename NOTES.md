# Project Notes ‚Äî Time Tracker Live

Notes, questions and observations collected during development.
This is a living document, not a polished artifact.

## üîç Questions to revisit

Things I'm curious about but not investigating right now.

- Why `<.button>` in HEEx has this `.` (dot) at the beginning?
- How do I define my own reusable components in Phoenix LiveView?
- Why are LiveView templates (e.g. `timer_live.html.heex`) kept in the same directory as the LiveView module, while controller templates are placed in directory named after controller (e.g. `page_html/`)?

## üß† Insights / Lessons Learned

- In LiveView modules, use `use MyAppWeb, :live_view` instead of `use Phoenix.LiveView`. This ensures shared components, layout, and helpers are available (e.g., `<.button>`).
